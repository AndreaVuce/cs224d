# Stanford CS224: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing
CS224D Assignments;
[`Assignment's Page`](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/assignments.html)

Notes
-----
* Certain featuers may require a compiler to be installed: Visual Studio C++, GCC, clang
* Code base is stored in separate assignment directories; might contain ipython notebooks used for running and displaying results;
* Assignment will contain a small number of python nmodules (and possibly test scripts)
* assignment directories might have a dataset directory (with either a scripts to download datasets, or at least details on how to get datasets);
